# Transactions

## Send Transactions

1. Get the receiving address
  - If the address is from within the wallet, you may click [copy publickey] on account display
2. Enter transaction page
  - Find the account to send the transaction and click [Transact] on account display
3. Enter transaction information
  - Enter receiving address, account password, amount ( total = send amount + fee (default 0.00021 SCDO) ). Cross shard transactions require higher fees (default 0.00063 SCDO) and will wait longer for confirmation
4. Click Send
  - Click [Send] to broadcast the transaction (or [cancel] to return to front page). If the wallet shows "broad cast successfully", click [ok] to return to front page.

Note: pay attention to the nodes wallet connect to, latency in synchronization may cause transactions to fail.

## View Transaction Status

- Users may check the transactions status in the Transaction List section. The status could be ```Wait``` or ```Done```. The number next to status is the shard that the transaction belongs to (1→2 meaning a cross-shard transaction from shard1 to shard2). It takes 20-30 seconds for a same shard transaction to complete, and 40-60 minutes for a cross-shard transaction.
- In the case of a cross shard transaction, expect the balance of the sending account to decrease first, and wait for 40-60 minutes for the balance to increase on the receiving account.
